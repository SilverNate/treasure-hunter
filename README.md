### Requirement

1. Build simple CLI program for hunting a treasure with requirement.

```bash
########
#......#
#.###..#
#...#.##
#X#....#
########
```
- '#' represents an obstacle.
- '.' represents a clear path.
- 'X' represents the playerâ€™s starting position.

2.  A treasure is hidden within one of the clear path points, and the user must find it.

3. From the starting position, the user must navigate in a specific order:  Up/North A step(s), then Right/East B step(s), then Down/South C step(s).

4. The program must output a list of probable coordinate points where the treasure might be located.

5. Bonus points: display the grid with all the probable treasure locations marked with a $ symbol.


### Solution

- Make sure python 3 already installed.
- Just built-in function used.
- First, run app with :
```bash
  cd Treasure-Hunt
  python3 index.py
```
- Choose which option you want :
```bash
    1 : Print Map
    2 : Print Map with Treasure
    3 : Print Treasure Position
    4 : Re-position of Treasure
    5 : Play Time!
    0 : Exit
    Option :0
```
- if you choose number 5 to play, it will show :
```bash
>> Map <<
########
#......#
#.###..#
#...#.##
#X#....#
########
>> Map With Treasure <<
########
#......#
#.###..#
#..$#.##
#X#....#
########
Treasure position : [[3, 3]]
```
- You can choose either up, right and down with number of your guess.
